# Kajian-Password-Generator

My first password generator. From the starter code that was given to me, I had the challenge of making my first password generator. When you open up the site press the generate password button so it asks you questions to generate a password for you. First it would ask for the length,which has to be between 8 and 128 characters, and then going forward to ask if it needs to include uppercase, lowercase, special and numeric characters in the password. The user just has to click "OK" or "cancel" to generate whatever password they desire. After all is done, it will display the password in the textbox. All I did was code the javascript portion. For installing my project you just need to clone this code to your repository.
